    <h2> Who are we?</h2>
    <p>We are researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) who do privacy and cybersecurity
        research. For our current project, we need to interview privacy professionals</p>
    <p> The team is overseen by <a href="https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/masooda-bashir">Professor Masooda
            Bashir</a>.</p>
    <h2>What's the research about?</h2>
    <p>We want to better understand how privacy engineers (and similar professionals) use and understand security and
        privacy frameworks, standards, and controls. </p>
    <p> We're interested in how privacy engineers work and think, what challenges they face, and how the privacy
        community can help.</p>

    <!-- <p>We're especially interested in several main research questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How do cloud privacy engineers use security and privacy frameworks, standards, and
            controls?</li>
        <li>What challenges do cloud privacy engineers face using security and privacy
            frameworks, standards, and controls?</li>
        <li>What opportunities can be identified in relation to cloud privacy engineers
            using security and privacy frameworks, standards, and controls?</li>
    </ul> -->
    <!-- <p>The draft interview questions are at the end of this document.</p> -->

    <h2>Who we are looking for?</h2>
    <p>We are seeking current or recently active privacy engineers, security architects, and others
        with similar roles - especially in cloud settings.</p>
    <p>You probably qualify if your job requires you to make decisions related to implementing data security and privacy
        protections.</p>

    <h2>How does the interview process work?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>We'll run interviews on Zoom or another platform of your choosing.</li>
        <li>Each interview will last 30-60 minutes.</li>
        <li>A friendly researcher will ask you questions about your work.</li>
        <li>After completing the interview, we'll offer you a $25 Amazon gift card as a thank you for your time.</li>
        <li>Audio or audio/video recording will be made <strong>only</strong> with your consent. If you don't consent, we'll just take notes.</li>
        <li>After the interview, we will use recordings to make pseudonymized transcripts.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>I'm interested, what do I do?!</h2>

    <p>To speed up the process for everyone, we are screening potential interviewees with a quick survey to make
        sure you fit the criteria. The survey takes less than a minute if you donâ€™t qualify, and about 5 minutes
        otherwise. If interested, please proceed with these steps:
    <ol>
        <li>Fill out the screening survey using this <a
                href="https://ischoolillinois.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_blbBL77Zfmhmzki">Qualtrix link</a>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Pick a good time for the interview using the Calendly link that appears after completing the screening survey</a>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>That's it! We look forward to chatting with you :)</p>
